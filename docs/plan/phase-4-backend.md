## Phase 4 — Backend ⛔ blocked on a decision

Deferred deliberately. Phases 0–3 are fully offline, so this choice is better made with real query
shapes in hand than guessed at up front.

**The decision:** Supabase was the original assumption. Alternatives under consideration, chosen for
free-tier viability:

| Option | RLS equivalent | Auth included | Dialect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Neon | native Postgres RLS | separate (Neon Auth / Better Auth / Clerk) | Postgres |
| Cloudflare D1 | app-layer only | no | SQLite |
| PocketBase (self-hosted) | per-record rules | yes | SQLite |
| Supabase | native RLS | yes | Postgres |

Neon is the least friction — HANDOFF §4's schema transfers unchanged and RLS stays enforced by the
database. D1 wins if the whole product consolidates on one Cloudflare account, at the cost of moving
the security boundary into application code, which for a table holding cost data is a real tradeoff.

Dialect matters concretely: HANDOFF §4 uses `jsonb` and a `coding_agents[]` array, and the blast-radius
query is a recursive CTE. SQLite has `WITH RECURSIVE` but neither `jsonb` nor array types, so a SQLite
target is a rewrite of the storage layer, not a port.

- [ ] Pick the backend
- [ ] Migrations for the HANDOFF §4 schema
- [ ] Row-level ownership policies, with a test proving a second user cannot read the first user's
      `user_service_accounts` — this table holds the cost data, so the policy review deserves a
      frontier model rather than a quick pass
- [ ] Views: `v_project_costs`, `v_service_blast_radius` (recursive CTE over edges), `v_phaseouts`
- [ ] Seed the global service catalog — roughly 40 services actually in use, with `simple-icons`
      slugs, category and pricing model
