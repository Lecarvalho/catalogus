## Phase 0 — Decisions and scaffold ✅

- [x] Resolve the open decisions from HANDOFF §9 that block the schema (see Decisions below)
- [x] pnpm workspace monorepo, ESM, TypeScript strict, vitest, tsup
- [x] `packages/schema`, `packages/core`, `packages/cli` skeletons
- [x] Root config: `tsconfig.base.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, `.gitignore`
- [x] `CLAUDE.md` orientation file
- [x] All dependencies installed in one pass
- [x] Repository published — published as `github.com/Lecarvalho/dagstree`, branch `main`, initial
      commit `712a8a6`; renamed to `github.com/Lecarvalho/catalogus` on 2026-08-24, which GitHub
      serves as a redirect from the old URL

Note: pnpm 11's build-approval gate blocks esbuild's postinstall, which tsup needs for its
platform-native binary. `pnpm-workspace.yaml` carries an `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` stanza to
permit it. Without that, tsup's build step silently lacks its native binary on Windows.

## Phase 1 — `packages/schema`, the contract ✅

The manifest schema is both the contract every other package consumes and the security boundary that
keeps Layer 3 data out of a public repo. Built first for that reason.

- [x] JSON Schema 2020-12 for `catalogus.yaml` v1 at `packages/schema/schema/catalogus.v1.json`
- [x] TypeScript types derived from the schema, with a drift test
- [x] `validateManifest` / `parseManifest`, Ajv 2020 dialect, `allErrors` on
- [x] **Private key-name rejection** — every object closed with `additionalProperties: false`, plus a
      separately-evaluated deny rule so the error message redirects to the private overlay rather than
      saying "additional property not allowed". A schema-sync test enforces that all five object types
      carry the identical deny pattern, so the closure cannot drift.
- [x] **Private value-level guard** (`src/free-text-guard.ts`) — generic recursive walk over every
      string value, two tiers. Hard hits (email, currency amount, amount tied to a billing period,
      card-length digit run, API-key shapes, credential URLs) are validation errors. Soft hits
      (billing, invoice, renewal, subscription, seat, plan tier, account, credentials) are warnings.
      Matched text is redacted in every message — first and last two characters only.
- [x] Referential integrity checks the schema itself cannot express: duplicate local ids, dangling
      dependency edge targets, unknown `replaced_by` targets
- [x] Fixture corpus under `test/fixtures/{valid,invalid}/`

Verified: the HANDOFF §5 worked example validates clean. Five adversarial key-name shapes (root
`cost`, camelCase `costAmount`, hyphenated `monthly-cost`, doubly-nested `account_ref`, uppercase
`BILLING`) all rejected. Nine value-smuggling shapes all rejected, including a YAML anchor/alias pair
and an amount inside a folded block scalar — the walk runs on the parsed object, after alias
resolution, so YAML-level indirection does not hide anything.

## Phase 2 — `packages/core`, the detection engine ✅

- [x] Spike `@specfy/stack-analyser` against real repos before designing anything —
      results recorded in `docs/detection-spike.md`
- [x] Slug mapping table (`src/mapping.ts`), derived from observed output, with category per entry
- [x] Unmapped detections preserved and flagged rather than silently dropped
- [x] Custom detectors stack-analyser lacks: coding agents (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`,
      `.agents/`, `.cursor/`, copilot instructions), MCP servers (`.mcp.json`, `.claude/settings.json`),
      hosting (`fly.toml`, `vercel.json`, `netlify.toml`, `render.yaml`, `wrangler.toml`),
      VCS and CI provider
- [x] Every detection carries evidence naming the file that proved it
- [x] Fixture-based tests, including the four-`fly.toml`-variants deduplication case

Verified against Clapline (read-only): Fly.io reported exactly once despite four `fly.toml` variants,
Claude Code detected once, evidence lists each distinct file once.

## Phase 3 — `packages/cli`, the offline commands ✅

No network, no auth, no backend. This is the phase that makes the tool useful day to day.

- [x] `catalogus init [path] [--yes] [--force]` — `--yes` fills project name, VCS provider and
      coding agents from detection and writes **no** service entries; see Phase 3.6's
      "init and add did not compose" for why that changed
- [x] `catalogus detect [path] [--json]`
- [x] `catalogus diff [path]` — reports both directions, and does not flag Layer 2 entries that are
      undetectable by design (a registrar, a PM tool) as stale
- [x] `catalogus validate [path] [--strict]` — schema, referential integrity, private-value guard,
      and the acyclicity check
- [x] `catalogus graph [path] [--mermaid]`
- [x] `catalogus add <service> [path] --role <r> [--depends-on <id>...]` — edits via the `yaml`
      Document API so comments and the `$schema` modeline survive
- [x] `catalogus set`, `catalogus link`, `catalogus deprecate` — added in Phase 3.6 to close the
      hand-edit gap; see "CLI gaps the skill exposed" below
- [x] `catalogus remove <id> [path]` — added in Phase 3.6; the only subtractive writer, and the one
      that makes a wrong `add` recoverable. See its own section below
- [x] `catalogus rename <old> <new> [path]` — the last writer, moving every edge and `replaced_by`
      that names the id along with the entry. See the `remove` section below
- [x] Manifest resolution: walks up from the working directory, `catalogus.yaml` preferred,
      `stack.yaml` accepted as a fallback on read, always writes `catalogus.yaml`
- [x] Errors to stderr, data to stdout, so `--json` stays pipeable

**Exit code contract** (verified by direct execution, all five):

| Situation | Exit |
|---|---|
| Valid manifest | 0 |
| Hard validation failure (schema, cycle, private value) | 1 |
| Soft warning only | 0, warning on stderr |
| Soft warning under `--strict` | 1 |
| Usage error — no manifest found, unreadable | 2 |

A detected cycle prints the actual path (`svc-a -> svc-b -> svc-c -> svc-a`), not merely the fact
that one exists. Toposort is iterative, and a self-edge is caught.

## Phase 3.5 — Defect fixes from verification ✅

Found by an independent verification pass over Phases 0–3 and fixed.

- [x] **Value-level private data was not screened by `validate`.** A hand-edited manifest carrying a
      cost amount, an email and a renewal date in `services[].notes` validated clean, exit 0. The
      guard existed but lived in the CLI and was only called on the `add` write path, so it vanished
      the moment anyone edited the YAML by hand — which is an entirely ordinary thing to ask an agent
      to do. Moved into `@catalogus/schema` and called by `validateManifest` itself, so Phase 5 push
      and Phase 6 MCP inherit the same boundary rather than each needing to remember it.
- [x] Hosting evidence was not deduplicated by file when the custom detector and stack-analyser both
      flagged the same file
- [x] `pnpm typecheck` was failing on a vitest mock-typing error in `packages/cli/src/cli.test.ts`
- [x] `add` took `--path` while every other command took a positional `[path]`; because
      `--depends-on` is variadic, a trailing path was silently swallowed as a dependency id

- [x] **The high-entropy token rule fired on ordinary prose.** Closed after three attempts and two
      adversarial reviews. Worth reading before touching `packages/schema/src/free-text-guard.ts`,
      because the first two fixes each looked correct and each shipped a worse guard.

      *The bug.* `LONG_TOKEN_RE` matches `[A-Za-z0-9+/]{32,}` because `/` and `+` are base64
      alphabet characters. They are also path separators. So the first genuine manifest anyone wrote
      failed HARD, exit 1, blocking `validate` and `graph`, on
      `Domain/Application/Infrastructure/Api` — a .NET layer list in an architecture description.

      *Attempt 1* excluded tokens whose `/`- and `+`-separated segments were all purely alphabetic.
      Review measured the assumption and it was false in both directions:
      `SECRET_KEY=<token>` validated CLEAN, a key laundered behind a path prefix
      (`config/secrets/<32-char key>`) validated CLEAN, digit-free base64 leaked at 0.26%, while
      absolute paths, trailing-slash paths, `.../Api/V2` and plain documentation URLs all still
      failed HARD.

      *Attempt 2* added label precedence, segment caps and a word-shape test. Review found
      doubled-separator schemes (`s3://`, `gs://`, `rsync://`, UNC `//host`) still failed HARD,
      because only one leading empty segment was dropped.

      *Current design*, in order: a secret label attached to the token (`hasSecretLabelBefore`) is an
      unconditional HARD hit that no exclusion can override; then split on `[+/]`, drop **all**
      leading and trailing empty segments, require at least two remaining, cap segment length, and
      require each segment to be word-shaped (letters plus a bounded digit suffix, with a word-start
      ratio floor).

      *Measured leak*, independently reproduced with crypto-random sampling against the built output:

      | alphabet | 32 chars | 40 chars | 64 chars |
      |---|---|---|---|
      | general (digits included) | 0.22% | 0.04% | 0.00% |
      | digit-free | 28.1% | 21.1% | 4.8% |

      **The digit-free row is a real, structural weakness, not a rounding error.** The required-clean
      fixture `MySQL8` pins the word-start ratio floor at exactly 3.0, and a random 50/50-case letter
      sequence averages about 4, so the shape test has little power against pure letters with no
      digits. It is tolerable today because a uniformly random base64 secret is digit-free at 32
      characters only about 0.4% of the time, which is why the general row — the number that governs
      real accidental-commit risk — stays near 0.2%. It would stop being tolerable if the threat
      model ever shifted from "a helpful agent pastes a secret by accident" to "someone shapes a
      secret to evade the guard". Enforced by `packages/schema/src/free-text-guard.leak.test.ts`,
      which uses a seeded deterministic PRNG and asserts a ceiling per length.

      *If you change this predicate:* re-run the leak test and update the measured numbers in the
      module comment. Both failed attempts asserted a rate in a comment without measuring it.
