## Phase 5 — Auth and push ⬜

- [ ] Device flow authentication (the `gh auth login` pattern: show a code, approve in a browser)
- [ ] Token stored in the OS keychain — use `@napi-rs/keyring`; `keytar` is unmaintained
- [ ] `catalogus login`
- [ ] `catalogus push` — manifest and detection upsert
- [ ] `catalogus push --private key=value` — field allow-list, hard-reject anything outside
      `account_ref`, `plan_tier`, `cost_amount`, `cost_currency`, `billing_cycle`, `renewal_date`,
      `started_at`, `notes_private`
- [ ] Test proving the token never lands in a file an agent can read into context
